# **🏦 PitBank**
PitBank is a Java-based CLI productivity ledger that models your focus sessions like a real banking system. Each completed Pit Stop is treated as a financial transaction, producing immutable daily statements and weekly summaries.

This project is inspired by racing pit stops and personal discipline systems — you earn only when you finish.

## 🚀 Why PitBank Exists
Most productivity tools focus on planning. PitBank focuses on execution.
- No endless to‑do lists
- No fake streaks
- No partial rewards

If a Pit Stop is completed → it is paid. If not → no transaction.
This mirrors how real banks and real systems work.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
- Completion over intention
- Immutable history (yesterday cannot be edited) (UnderTesting)
- Time‑based state management 
- Simple CLI, serious logic

PitBank is intentionally CLI-only to keep the focus on logic, discipline, and systems thinking — not UI distractions.

## 🧩 Features
✅ Daily Pit Stop Statements
- Each day generates a separate statement file
- Every Pit Stop is logged as a transaction
- Once a day is closed, it cannot be modified

💰 Sponsor-Based Rewards
- Different domains have different sponsor values
- Example:
    - Cybersecurity → $10M
    - Stock Market → $5M
    - Academics → $0.5M

## My Learning
I create projects that makes one programming concept fit in a Big Picture. Like that, In this project I learned the following:
1. Modular Programming
2. OOPS Principles
3. Terminal Control (CLI)
4. Date and Time in Java
5. File Management in Java

I actually planned this project to learn more about Java's Object Oriented based file handling. I learned Java in my 3rd Semester Anna University Curriculam. This part is very limited so, I planned a project. Successfully in this project I learned the most of File Operations and Streams

**This project may not be large in scope, but it focuses on understanding how individual libraries and concepts fit into a larger system.**

## 🧑‍💻 Who This Is For
- Developers who value discipline
- Cybersecurity & systems learners
- CLI enthusiasts
- Anyone who wants proof of work, not promises

## 🖤 Final Note
PitBank is not about productivity hacks. It is about showing up, finishing, and recording reality.

*You don’t get paid for thinking about racing. You get paid for finishing the lap.*

**Built with focus. Logged with honesty.**
